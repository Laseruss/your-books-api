# your-books-api

Not really sure what this is going to be yet.
But I want to be able to store the books I have read with maybe some average rating from (e.g) goodreads,
And perhaps a short review. 

A lot of credit to Alex Edwards and his books Let's go and Let's go further, which this project takes a lot
of inspiration from, but i aim to expand on this api.
